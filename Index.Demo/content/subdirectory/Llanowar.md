Description
-----------

Llanowar ranges in width from several hundred miles to over a thousand miles at its widest point. 
This haunted forest is populated by the Llanowar elves, fierce beings who are outcasts among 
elvenkind. Redwood treefolk live in the heart of Llanowar, and aboroths are powerful elementals 
that grow from the soil and terrorize the elves on occasion. The forest is known to goblins as the 
Forest of Death. Mirri, a cat-warrior who was trained in magic together with Gerrard, lived for a 
while in Llanowar.
